# Ignore RUSTSEC-2023-0071 for rsa crate
# This vulnerability comes from sqlx-mysql which is NOT being used in this project.
# We only use sqlx with the postgres feature, so the MySQL driver (and its rsa dependency)
# is not actually compiled or included in the binary.
# Verified with: cargo tree | grep -i rsa (returns nothing)
